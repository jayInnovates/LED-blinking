### ⚙️ Wiring:
- Connect the **longer leg (anode)** of the LED to **pin 8** on the Arduino.
- Connect the **shorter leg (cathode)** of the LED to one side of the **100 Ohm resistor**.
- Connect the other side of the resistor to **GND** on the Arduino.

## 🧑‍🔧 How It Works
The LED is connected to pin 8 on the Arduino UNO. The Arduino will turn the LED on for 500 milliseconds and off for 500 milliseconds, creating a blinking effect.
